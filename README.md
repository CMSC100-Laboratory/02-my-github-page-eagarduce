## 💡 Key Takeaways

- **HTML can be tedious** — Writing HTML requires attention to detail with proper nesting, closing tags, and semantic structure. It takes patience to get everything right!

- **CSS is fun and creative** — Styling with CSS allows for creative expression. Experimenting with colors, layouts, and animations makes the design process enjoyable.

- **Organization is key** — Separating styles into multiple CSS files (navbar, about, projects, skills, references) makes the code more maintainable and easier to debug.
